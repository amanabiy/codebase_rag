3. Run to install all dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run to start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Access the application at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage
Once you have set up the application, you can interact with it in a web browser. The application provides the following functionality:
- A route that returns a welcome message

## Commands
- `npm install`: Installs all dependencies required by the application
- `npm start`: Starts the development server
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite (not currently implemented in this application)
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production
- `npm run deploy`: Deploys the application to a production environment (not currently implemented in this application)

## Debugging
