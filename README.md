# Codebase RAG

## Overview

This project, **Codebase RAG**, implements an AI expert over a codebase using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The web app allows users to chat with a codebase to understand how it works and identify areas for improvement.

## Features

- **Chat with Codebase**: Users input queries, and the most relevant code snippets are retrieved to generate responses using an LLM.
- **Embedding Codebase**: The contents of the codebase are embedded and stored in a vector database called Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
- **Web App**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the codebase.
- **Multiple Codebases**: Allow users to select different codebases to chat with.
- **Webhook Integration**: Update the Pinecone index automatically when new commits are pushed to the repository.
